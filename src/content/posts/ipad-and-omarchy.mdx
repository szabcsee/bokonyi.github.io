# Remote Access to Omarchy from iPad using wayvnc and Tailscale

I have been playing with Omarchy on my Lenovo Legion since a few weeks ago, while waiting for my Bee-Link SER8 to arrive. It has arrived finally yesterday and It was a breeze
to swap SSDs and get everything up and running. So fast that actually I started to look around the flat, what else I could get involved in the Omarchy madness.
Probably I will have zero use of it, but my eyes landed on the iPad. And some Claude-ing around and a few articles later I have a relatively secured connection
and a comfortable resolution switch hotkey set up to connect from anywhere if needed. The process is tried and works so I hope you will appreciate it. 
The hardware is a 2019 or 2020 iPad Pro and a Bee-Link SER8.

I found a great article on [acrogenesis.com](https://acrogenesis.com/remote-access-to-omarchy-with-wayvnc-and-tailscale/) that covers the Omarchy side, but needed some tweak for the wayland config to work.

Step 3 I totally ignored because authenticating with Tailscale at tailscale up already gave me everything and I was able to connect after as I already had the ip.

## Why This Setup?

**wayvnc** is a VNC server specifically designed for Wayland compositors like Hyprland. Traditional VNC servers (like x11vnc) only work with X11, making wayvnc essential for Wayland environments.

**Tailscale** creates a secure, encrypted peer-to-peer VPN using WireGuard. This means:
- No need to open firewall ports
- End-to-end encryption
- Access your machine from anywhere
- Zero-trust security model
- Your desktop never exposed to the public internet

## Prerequisites

- Omarchy (Hyprland on Arch) installed and running
- An iPad (any model will work)
- A Tailscale account (free for personal use)

## Step 1: Install wayvnc and Tailscale

On your Omarchy machine, install the required packages:
```bash
yay -S wayvnc tailscale
```

For Tailscale, you can also use the Omarchy menu:
```
Menu: Install → Service → Tailscale
```

Enable and start Tailscale:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now tailscaled
sudo tailscale up
```

Tailscale will give you a secure private IP (something like `100.x.y.z`) that works anywhere, without opening firewall ports.

## Step 2: Configure wayvnc

This is the crucial step that many guides miss! By default, wayvnc only listens on `127.0.0.1` (localhost), which won't accept connections from other devices.

Create the wayvnc config directory and file:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/wayvnc
nano ~/.config/wayvnc/config
```

Add the following configuration:
```
address=0.0.0.0
port=5900
enable_auth=false
```

**Note on security:** We're disabling authentication because Tailscale already provides strong encryption and authentication. Your VNC connection is only accessible through your private Tailscale network, not the public internet.

Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

## Step 3: Get Your Tailscale IP

On your Omarchy machine:
```bash
tailscale ip -4
```

This will output something like `100.115.92.30`. **Write this down**—you'll need it to connect from your iPad.

You can also find this IP in the Tailscale admin panel or by running:
```bash
tailscale status
```

## Step 4: Find Your Monitor Configuration

To optimize the experience for iPad, you'll want to know your monitor setup. Run:
```bash
hyprctl monitors
```

This will show your connected monitors, their names (e.g., `HDMI-A-1`, `DP-2`), and current resolutions.

For example:
```
Monitor HDMI-A-1 (ID 0):
	2560x1080@59.97800 at 0x0
	description: LG Electronics LG ULTRAWIDE
```

Note your monitor name and native resolution—you'll need this for the resolution toggle script.

## Step 5: Create a Resolution Toggle Script (Optional but Recommended)

If you have an ultrawide monitor (21:9 aspect ratio like 2560x1080 or 3440x1440), viewing it on an iPad's 4:3 screen will make everything tiny and difficult to use. A resolution toggle script lets you switch to an iPad-friendly resolution when connecting remotely.

Create `~/toggle-resolution.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
MONITOR="HDMI-A-1"  # Change this to match your monitor name

CURRENT=$(hyprctl monitors | awk -v mon="$MONITOR" '
    $2 == mon {getline; print $1}' )

if [[ "$CURRENT" == 2560x1080* ]]; then
    echo "Switching to iPad-friendly resolution (1920x1080@60)..."
    hyprctl keyword monitor "$MONITOR,1920x1080@60,0x0,1"
elif [[ "$CURRENT" == 1920x1080* ]]; then
    echo "Switching back to UltraWide (2560x1080@60)..."
    hyprctl keyword monitor "$MONITOR,2560x1080@60,0x0,1"
else
    echo "Current mode is $CURRENT — defaulting to UltraWide."
    hyprctl keyword monitor "$MONITOR,2560x1080@60,0x0,1"
fi
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/toggle-resolution.sh
```

### Add a Keyboard Shortcut (Optional)

Add this to `~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf`:
```
bindd = SUPER SHIFT, R, Toggle Resolution, exec, ~/toggle-resolution.sh
```

Now you can press `Super+Shift+R` to toggle between your native ultrawide resolution and an iPad-friendly resolution.

## Step 6: Start wayvnc

In a terminal on your Omarchy machine:
```bash
wayvnc --log-level=debug
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Info: Capturing output HDMI-A-1
Info: >> LG Electronics LG ULTRAWIDE (HDMI-A-1) 2560x1080+0x0
Info: Listening for connections on 0.0.0.0:5900
```

**Important:** Make sure it says `0.0.0.0:5900` and NOT `127.0.0.1:5900`. If it says `127.0.0.1`, double-check your config file from Step 2.

### Auto-start wayvnc (Optional)

To have wayvnc start automatically, you can create a systemd user service:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/wayvnc.service
```

Add:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=wayvnc VNC server
After=graphical-session.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/wayvnc
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now wayvnc.service
```

## Step 7: Set Up Your iPad

### Install Tailscale

1. Download **Tailscale** from the App Store
2. Open it and sign in with the **same account** you used on your Omarchy machine
3. Both devices should now appear in your Tailscale network

### Install a VNC Client

You have two main options (I went with the first):

**OzRealVNC Viewer (Free)**
- Simple and functional
- Good keyboard support
- Free to use

**Option 2: Screens 5 (Paid)**
- More polished interface
- Better gesture support
- Excellent keyboard and trackpad integration
- One-time purchase or subscription

Download your preferred VNC client from the App Store.

## Step 8: Connect from iPad

On your Omarchy machine, switch to iPad-friendly resolution:
```bash
~/toggle-resolution.sh
```

Or press `Super+Shift+R` if you set up the keyboard shortcut.

### Connect with RealVNC Viewer

1. Open **RealVNC Viewer**
2. Tap the **+** button to add a new connection
3. Enter your Tailscale IP: `100.x.y.z:5900` (use the IP from Step 3)
4. Give it a name like "Omarchy Desktop"
5. Tap **Connect**

### Connect with Screens 5

1. Open **Screens**
2. Tap **+** to add a new screen
3. Choose "New Screen"
4. Enter your Tailscale IP: `100.x.y.z`
5. Port: `5900`
6. Name it "Omarchy"
7. Tap **Connect**

You should now see your Omarchy desktop on your iPad! If yes, Congratulations! 

## Using Your iPad as a Development Machine

With this setup, your iPad becomes a powerful remote terminal for your Omarchy machine. Here are some workflows:

### Terminal Access via SSH

For command-line work (like using Claude Code), SSH over Tailscale is even more responsive than VNC:

1. Install **Blink Shell** or **Termius** on your iPad
2. Add your Tailscale IP as an SSH host
3. Connect with your username and password (or SSH keys)

### Hybrid Workflow

- Use **SSH** for terminal work and coding
- Use **VNC** when you need the graphical desktop environment

### With External Keyboard

If you have an iPad with Magic Keyboard or any Bluetooth keyboard, the experience becomes even better. The Super key (Windows key) will be passed through to Hyprland, giving you access to all your Omarchy shortcuts.

## Troubleshooting

### wayvnc hangs or shows no output

Run with debug logging:
```bash
wayvnc --log-level=debug
```

Check that it's listening on `0.0.0.0:5900`, not `127.0.0.1:5900`.

### Can't connect from iPad

1. Verify both devices show up in Tailscale:
```bash
   tailscale status
```

2. Check wayvnc is running:
```bash
   ps aux | grep wayvnc
```

3. Verify the port is open:
```bash
   ss -tulpn | grep 5900
```

### Connection is slow or laggy

- Try switching to a lower resolution with the toggle script
- Ensure both devices have good internet connections
- Tailscale usually provides direct peer-to-peer connections, but if it's using relay servers (DERP), performance may vary

### Screen resolution doesn't look right

Run the toggle script before connecting, or manually set a resolution that works better for iPad:
```bash
hyprctl keyword monitor "HDMI-A-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1"
```

## Security Considerations

This setup is secure because:

1. **Tailscale provides encryption**: All traffic is encrypted with WireGuard
2. **No exposed ports**: Your VNC server is never exposed to the public internet
3. **Zero-trust model**: Only devices authenticated in your Tailscale network can connect
4. **Private IP space**: Tailscale uses the `100.x.y.z` CGNAT address space

We disabled VNC authentication because Tailscale already handles authentication and encryption. If you prefer defense-in-depth, you can enable VNC authentication by removing `enable_auth=false` from the config and setting a password.

## Conclusion

With Omarchy (Hyprland on Arch), wayvnc, and Tailscale, you have a secure, practical remote desktop setup that works from anywhere. The combination of a resolution toggle script and an iPad with keyboard gives you flexibility to use an ultrawide monitor at your desk while maintaining a laptop-friendly experience when connecting remotely.

Whether you're using your iPad for quick administrative tasks, development work with Claude Code, or full desktop access on the go, this setup provides a professional-grade solution without the complexity or security risks of traditional VPN or port-forwarding setups.
