# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

I am Szabi. I write code, build products, and try to keep things real. 


Iâ€™ve been in software development for years. From airlines to online media outlets, from big companies to small ones.


What interests me most now is where **technology and creativity overlap** â€” especially AI, automation, and new ways of building on the web.
Other times itâ€™s gadgets, comics, art, science, or the odd home hack.  
Philosophy, psychology, and general life stuff also make their way in here.  

The posts here arenâ€™t polished manifestos.  
Theyâ€™re notes from the process â€” wins, mistakes, and everything in between.  
I donâ€™t have a strict theme â€” itâ€™s more like an open notebook.  

If that sounds useful, stick around.
